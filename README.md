### *How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?*

&nbsp;&nbsp; User stories describe the desired features of the software from the user's perspective which identifies their needs. You can then prioritize user stories in order of importance. Since this is part of the Agile approach, you are able to make adjustments to requirements throughout the Sprint.

### *How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?*

&nbsp;&nbsp; When approaching a development project, you must break the work down into smaller tasks to be implemented during Sprints. Each Sprint requires planning, analyzing, developing, testing, and implementing.

&nbsp;&nbsp; I look forward to incorporating the Scrum framework to manage projects and the Lean methodology to focus on value and minimize waste. I am a visual person, so Kanban boards (or a tracking software such as Jira) will be extremely useful for me.

### *What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?*

&nbsp;&nbsp; Agile software development is collaborative and being a team player is crucial to the success of the project. A good team member writes cleaner code, knows the client's requirements, shares experiences, and trusts his/her team members. It's also important to have strong communication skills, a desire to learn, a positive attitude, and a good work ethic.
